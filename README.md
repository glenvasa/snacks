## Freelance Project
- Customized for use by nutrition/healthy living direct sales representatives.
- Reps previously had to advance customer order costs and receive payment through cash on delivery.
- Payment is now received through Paypal/credit card upon order placement.
- Customers can place orders online instead of previous method (with their rep by phone, text, or email message).
- Orders are trackable online and reps can manage featured inventory and change stage of order status on Admin dashboard.  

## Deployed Application
- https://snacks-psi.vercel.app/ 
- For testing use "admin"/"admin" for Admin page username/password
- Create a test cash order or use PayPal sandbox email/username and follow order on Order Tracking page.
